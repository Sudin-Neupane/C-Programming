This repository contains a collection of C and C++ programs created for learning and practicing fundamental programming concepts. Usually, I push code in this repo after studying in the classroom.  It includes basic to intermediate-level examples covering topics such as input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, conditional statements, loops, arrays, matrices, functions, recursion, searching and sorting algorithms, file handling, pattern printing, and number-based problems such as prime numbers, factorials, Fibonacci series, and LCM. The purpose of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve logical thinking, and build a solid foundation in programming for me,  as well as  to prepare for exams, assignments, or interviews.
