This repository contains a collection of C and C++ programs created for learning and practicing fundamental programming concepts. It includes basic to intermediate level examples covering topics such as input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, conditional statements, loops, arrays, matrices, functions, recursion, searching and sorting algorithms, file handling, pattern printing, and number-based problems like prime numbers, factorial, Fibonacci series, and LCM. The purpose of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve logical thinking, and build a solid foundation in programming for me  and  preparing for exams, assignments, or interviews.
